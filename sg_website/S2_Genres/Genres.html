			<h2 class="text-center">1. Network Construction and Graph Analysis</h2>
			<p></p>
			<p><b>Spotify</b> contains more than 1000 genres. We were really interested on how these genres are interconnected between them and if they form communities. As a result, we decided to make a Network that consists of these Genres. Every node of the network is a genre and two genres are connected with an edge if and only if they have more than 20% of artists in common.</p>
			<p>A static Image of a part of our Graph looks like this:</p>
			<div><img src="img/spotify_genres_cropped.png" alt="graph img" height="815" width="1100"  /></div>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>If you want a dynamic and interactive overview of the graph, click <a href="#"><b>here</b></a>.</p>
			<br>
			<p>We will proceed to the Analysis of our Network</p>
			<br>
			<h4><b>Let's explore degree distributions</b></h4>
			<p>The maximum degree in our network is 21. <br>This means that the most connected genre has 21 connections/edges to other genres.</p>
			<p><b>Let's take a look at our Network's Degree Distributions:</b></b>
			<div><img src="img/Linear.png" alt="graph img" height="400" width="600"  /></div>
			<div><img src="img/Log.png" alt="graph img" height="400" width="600"  /></div>
			<br>
		</div>
		<br>
		<p>Who are the most interconnected genres? Let's find out by calculating the top 10 highest degree nodes:</p>
		<p><b>The top 10 genres by degree are:</b><br>
			jazz christmas<br>
			permanent wave<br>
			melancholia<br>
			memphis blues<br>
			chicago blues<br>
			blues<br>
			alternative rock<br>
			louisiana blues<br>
			house<br>
			traditional blues</p>
		<p>We can see so many blues sub-genres in there. If one pays attention to the graph too, can really see that blues are a small but tightly connected cluster. That leads us to the conclusion that blues is divided to some small subgenres which in reality are very strongly connected, containing a lot of the same artists.<br>Jazz Christmas and Permanent Wave are also some of the most highly connected Genres that act as Hubs in our Network.<p>
		<br>
		<h4><b>Let's explore the Centralities in our Netwrok</b></h4>
		<p><b>Betweeness Centrality</b><br>The top 5 genres on Spotify by betweenness centrality:<br>
				indie r &amp b<br>
				pop rap<br>
				glam rock<br>
				permanent wave<br>
				synthpop<br> </p>
		<p>The betweenness centrality shows that these genres can always be found on the paths that lead to other genres. They act as "bridges".</p>
		<br>
		<p><b>Eigenvector Centrality</b><br>The top 5 genres on Spotify by eigenvector centrality:<br>
				memphis blues<br>
				chicago blues<br>
				blues<br>
				traditional blues<br>
				louisiana blues<br></p>
		<p>Eigenvector centrality is a measure of the influence of a node in a network. It is based on the concept that connections to high-degree nodes contribute more to the score of the node in question than equal connections to low-scoring nodes. Hence, 5 most central genres according to eigenvector centrality are the ones connected to most high scoring genres. As we can see these are all blues genres, which leads us to the conclusion that this small community consists of many high degree nodes that are interconnected to each other.</p>
		<br>
		<h4><b>Let's investigate the Assortativity of our Netwrok</b></h4>
		<p><b>Assortativity</b> is a preference for a network's nodes to attach to others that are similar in some way. We will investigate <b>degree assortativity</b>, thus investigate if high degree nodes (genres with many connections to other genres) have a preference to connect to other high degree nodes.</p>
		<p>The <b>assortativity degree coefficient</b> of our network is <b>0.47</b>. Since it is a positive number, and bigger enough than zero, it proves that our network is in fact assortative with respects to degree.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h2 class="text-center">2. Evolution of Music Genres Through History</h2>
		<p>Musical genres have changed and evolved through the years. Genres that were popular in the past have faded out and other genres sprouted up and became influencial in the recent years. It is really interesting to track and oversee this path. We collected all the 1000 <b>Spotify</b> genres and combined them to <b>16</b> basic ones, based on <b>Wikipedia's</b> list of main genres.</p>

		<div class="image-pool">
			<div class="rock hide">
				<img src="img/Years Active Images/rock and metal.png" alt="Rock Plot" height="550" width="1100" />
				<p>As we can see, Rock and Metal have evolved and grew up steadily from 1960 up to today, following a completery linear growth. This is probably due to the fact that most Rock Artists that started their career at the 60s-70s are still active until today, along with every other artist of the upcoming decades.  </p>
			</div>
			<div class="pop hide">
				<img src="img/Years Active Images/pop.png" alt="Pop Plot" height="550" width="1100" />
				<p>It is clear from the plot that Pop did not have that many artists (less than 2000) up until the 90s when it started growing up steadily, especially with the new millenia.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="electronic hide">
				<img src="img/Years Active Images/electronic.png" alt="Electronic Plot" height="550" width="1100" />
				<p>Electronic music as it is expected, was almost non-existent as a genre up to 1990. Then it started taking some shy steps to the music scene and booming after 2000. It managed to almost quadriple the number of active artists in the last 20 years. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="jazz hide">
				<img src="img/Years Active Images/jazz.png" alt="Jazz Plot" height="550" width="1100" />
				<p>Jazz is one of the smallest genres, counting less than 1500 artists in total. However, it shows a really steady progress, managing to retain the same number of active artists for more than 30 years (60-90) and shows a little more growth after 1990. Also, it seems to be having less artists in the last 10 years.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="rb hide">
				<img src="img/Years Active Images/r&b and soul.png" alt="R&B and Soul Plot" height="550" width="1100" />
				<p>R&B and Soul shows a really interesting pattern. It was almost non-existen up to 1960s when it started growing steadily up to 1975. Then it became stable for a whole of 15 years and it seems that the '90s gave it a push to revive itself. It gained 500 new artists in less than a decade and what is most interesting is that after 2005 show a massive boom gaining another 500 artists in a few years.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="rap hide">
				<img src="img/Years Active Images/hip hop and rap.png" alt="Hip Hop and Rap Plot" height="550" width="1100" />
				<p>Hip Hop and Rap is the perfect examples of modern Genres. It is evident that until 1990 this genre was almost non-existent. With the coming of the '90s though it grew suddenly and managed to quadriple the number of artists in the last 20 years. Furthermore, More than a 1000 new artists became active in just the last decade.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="blues hide">
				<img src="img/Years Active Images/blues.png" alt="Blues Plot" height="550" width="1100" />
				<p>Blues, one of the small gernes with less than 700 artists in total started growing at the 60s and saw its peak at the 70s. After that milestone though, it has been steadily losing artists and despite some flunctuations during the 90s it has a downward trend. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="folk hide">
				<img src="img/Years Active Images/folk.png" alt="Folk Plot" height="550" width="1100" />
				<p>Folk seems to have started to catch up after 1970 and grew slowly and steadily up to the 90s. After that though, its increase became more sharp, gaining 1000 artists in the last 20 years. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="easy hide">
				<img src="img/Years Active Images/easy listening.png" alt="Easy Listening Plot" height="550" width="1100" />
				<p>Easy Listening is a Genre that refers to less than 160 artists. Its pattern is interesting to analyse though. We spot a sharp increase at 1985 peaking at 1990 and then starting to fall downwards up until 2010 where it seems it saw some kind of revival.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="avantgarde hide">
				<img src="img/Years Active Images/avantgarde.png" alt="Avantagarde Plot" height="550" width="1100" />
				<p>Avantgarde counted around only 50 artists up to 1990 when it saw an increase in active artists. It started to grow steadily and despite a small fall at 2005 it peaked at its maximum after 2010.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="country hide">
				<img src="img/Years Active Images/country.png" alt="Country Plot" height="550" width="1100" />
				<p>Country musicians seem to steadily increase throughout the whole of the last half of the century. Furthermore, it seems that more and more are remaining active in the later decades, helping the genre grow steadily up to today, tottaling almost 1600 active artists.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="latin hide">
				<img src="img/Years Active Images/latin.png" alt="Latin Plot" height="550" width="1100" />
				<p>Latin music has a steady growth from 1960 and onwards, reacing almost 1200 active artists today.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="african hide">
				<img src="img/Years Active Images/african.png" alt="African Plot" height="550" width="1100" />
				<p>Independent African music started to develop after 1970 and remained generally stable for 30 years. From 2000 and onwards though, the active artists in the genre almost doubled during the last decade.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="carribean hide">
				<img src="img/Years Active Images/carribean.png" alt="Carribean Plot" height="550" width="1100" />
				<p>Carribean music shows an impressive steady growth. Managed to get from 200 artists at 1960 to 1000 active artists today.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="asian hide">
				<img src="img/Years Active Images/asian.png" alt="Asian Plot" height="550" width="1100" />
				<p>Asian music started evolving after the 90s but the most interesting finding is the sharp growth it saw from 2010 until today. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="comedy hide">
				<img src="img/Years Active Images/comedy.png" alt="Comedy Plot" height="550" width="1100" />

		<h4>Comment:</h4>
		<p>Looking at how many years each Artists is Active tells us about the growth of the genre in general but does not tell us how the genre actually evolved with every decade change, since the artists that remain active for a lot of years appear and get counted in every following decade, thus increasing the number of artists in every decade. Thus, we will try to see what happens if we plot the number of artists in each decade based only on the artists that got actually created in this decade.</p>
		<h3 class="text-center">Evolution of Music Genres based on Artists' Starting Year.</h3>
		<p>Let's look how many artists started their carreer in every decade, for every genre.</p>

		<div class="image-pool2">
			<div class="rock2 hide">
				<img src="img/Years Started Images/rock and metal.png" alt="" height="550" width="1100" />
				<p>As we can see, Rock started to grow up at 60s with more and more artists starting up at '65, even more than those in the famous '70s. From the '80s and onwards though Rock really spiraled up and continues to grow ap to 2000. It is also evident that after 2000 less and less new bands get created. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="pop2 hide">
				<img src="img/Years Started Images/pop.png" alt="Pop Plot" height="550" width="1100" />
				<p>Pop really did not attract many artists up until the 90s where it saw its first big boom and grew sharply up to its peak at 2000.Also, we can see that the number of new artists from 2010 up to today is extremely low.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="electronic2 hide">
				<img src="img/Years Started Images/electronic.png" alt="Electronic Plot" height="550" width="1100" />
				<p>As it is ecpected, Artists that played Electronic music started to appear closing up to 1990. After that though, we see more and more artists in every decade, with the number of new artists to triple up in one decade </p>				
			</div>
			<div class="jazz2 hide">
				<img src="img/Years Started Images/jazz.png" alt="Jazz Plot" height="550" width="1100" />
				<p>The Jazz plot is really interesting, especially in comparison to the one with active years where we could see that jazz was stable throughout. Looking at the above graph though, we can clearly see that this is not the case. We see that more and more artists played jazz during the 50s and 60s but there was a fall during 70s and 80s (when Rock started to become more popular) Though in the 90s was a sudden and sharp boom in the number of new artists, signaling a revival of the genre. Furthermore, after that, less and less new artists appeared and especially the last 10 years there are almost no new artists playing jazz. Comparing this graph to the one above, we can also conclude that Jazz artists remain active for a lot of years and thus the artists from the '70s and '90s are the ones responsible for the stable look at the years active graph.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="rb2 hide">
				<img src="img/Years Started Images/r&b and soul.png" alt="R&B and Soul Plot" height="550" width="1100" />
				<p>R&B and Soul shows a really interesting pattern. Except from a spark at 1955, there was a flat and stable number of new artists in every decade but saw a big fall during 80-90. At the '90s though it started growing again with more and more artists appearing every year and especially at 2000 peaked with almost 70 new artists. It is undergoing a fall in the recent years though.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="rap2 hide">
				<img src="img/Years Started Images/hip hop and rap.png" alt="Hip Hop and Rap Plot" height="550" width="1100" />
				<p>Hip Hop and Rap is the perfect examples of modern Genres. Up to 1985 there were almost no artists occupied with this genre. After that step though and especially after 1990 this genre attracted more and more artists. We can also see a downward trend in the recent years. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="blues2 hide">
				<img src="img/Years Started Images/blues.png" alt="Blues Plot" height="550" width="1100" />
				<p>Blues, as one would expect, is one of the "old" genres. More artists appeared during the '50s and '60s and then saw a downward spiral up to today. Considering that the graph based on active years show a stable pattern, we can conclude that most of the artists that appeared during the '60s are still active today. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="folk2 hide">
				<img src="img/Years Started Images/folk.png" alt="Folk Plot" height="550" width="1100" />
				<p>Folk saw a growth of new artis during '65-70 but then saw very few artists for the following 20 years. After '90s though folk music started to see more and more artists every decade seeing its maximum peak at 2000. In the recent years though it seems it does not attract new artists. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="easy2 hide">
				<img src="img/Years Started Images/easy listening.png" alt="Easy Listening Plot" height="550" width="1100" />
				<p>Easy Listening being maybe the smallest genre, shows big flunctuations. It is clear though that more artists appeared during 1950-60 and again at 1980-90.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="avantgarde2 hide">
				<img src="img/Years Started Images/avantgarde.png" alt="Avantagarde Plot" height="550" width="1100" />
				<p>Avantgarde really started to appear after 1985 and was at its peak with the most new artists appearing at 1995-2000. Some more new artists seem to have appeared recently after 2010.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="country2 hide">
				<img src="img/Years Started Images/country.png" alt="Country Plot" height="550" width="1100" />
				<p>Country shows a really interesting stability with approximately 20 artists appearing every 5 years up until 1990 (except a minor fall during 1975-80). During 1990 though this number doubled up to 40 new artists and kept being high up until 2010 when it saw a sharp fall. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="latin2 hide">
				<img src="img/Years Started Images/latin.png" alt="Latin Plot" height="550" width="1100" />
				<p>Latin music saw a boom of new artists at 1960-1965 and then saw a fall with only 10 new artists appearing every 5 years.During 1990 though, it spiraled up again and amanged to remain stable for the next 15 years up to 2005, seeing almost 30 artists every 5 years. After that though, new artists are almost non-existent. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="african2 hide">
				<img src="img/Years Started Images/african.png" alt="African Plot" height="550" width="1100" />
				<p>Africann artists seem to gather during the 70s and then some more appeared during 2000 but in between we see very few new artists appearing.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="carribean2 hide">
				<img src="img/Years Started Images/carribean.png" alt="Carribean Plot" height="550" width="1100" />
				<p>Carribean music shows a steady growth with 15 artists appearing every 5 years and doubled that number spiraling up to 30 after 1990.</p>

		<h3 class="text-center">Evolution of Music Genres Popularity</h3>
		<p>We looked at the number of artists in every decade and came to conclusions about the growth of every genre. But, how many times have you wondered how popular a genre is? And, how its popularity changed over the years? We will try to answer these questions by using the <b>Popularity</b> value of <b>Spotify</b> for every Artist. However, how does one define what popularity is? We will try two different approaches and analyze both results. Firstly, we will define the popularity of every decade as the sum of all Popularity values of all artists in that decade.</p>

		<p>Let's look how popularity changed through decades for every genre.</p>

		<h4>Comment:</h3>
		<p>The above graphs give us a really good estimate of how popularity changed for every change during the change of time. But, it can also be misleading. Since the popularity was calculated as the total of all popularities, a decade which had a few but really popular artists would be shown the same way as a decade with a lot but not so popular artists. Since the popularity is subjective, some might actually argue that more artists are indeed a proof of a more popular genre. Nevertheless, in order to tackle all these questions, we calculated the popularities a second time, but this time we defined popularity as the average value of all the individual popularities in this decade.</p>
