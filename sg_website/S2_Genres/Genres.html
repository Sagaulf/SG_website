      <p>Musical genres have changed and evolved through the years. Genres that were popular in the past have faded out and other genres sprouted up and became influencial in the recent years. It is really interesting to track and oversee this path. </p>

		<div class="image-pool">

			<div class="rock hide">
				<img src="img/Years Active Images/rock and metal.png" alt="Rock Plot" height="550" width="1100" />
				<p>As we can see, Rock and Metal have evolved and grew up steadily from 1960 up to today, following a completery linear growth. This is probably due to the fact that most Rock Artists that started their career at the 60s-70s are still active until today, along with every other artist of the upcoming decades.  </p>
			</div>
			<div class="pop hide">
				<img src="img/Years Active Images/pop.png" alt="Pop Plot" height="550" width="1100" />
				<p>It is clear from the plot that Pop did not have that many artists (less than 2000) up until the 90s when it started growing up steadily, especially with the new millenia.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="electronic hide">
				<img src="img/Years Active Images/electronic.png" alt="Electronic Plot" height="550" width="1100" />
				<p>Electronic music as it is expected, was almost non-existent as a genre up to 1990. Then it started taking some shy steps to the music scene and booming after 2000. It managed to almost quadriple the number of active artists in the last 20 years. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="jazz hide">
				<img src="img/Years Active Images/jazz.png" alt="Jazz Plot" height="550" width="1100" />
				<p>Jazz is one of the smallest genres, counting less than 1500 artists in total. However, it shows a really steady progress, managing to retain the same number of active artists for more than 30 years (60-90) and shows a little more growth after 1990. Also, it seems to be having less artists in the last 10 years.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="rb hide">
				<img src="img/Years Active Images/r&b and soul.png" alt="R&B and Soul Plot" height="550" width="1100" />
				<p>R&B and Soul shows a really interesting pattern. It was almost non-existen up to 1960s when it started growing steadily up to 1975. Then it became stable for a whole of 15 years and it seems that the '90s gave it a push to revive itself. It gained 500 new artists in less than a decade and what is most interesting is that after 2005 show a massive boom gaining another 500 artists in a few years.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="rap hide">
				<img src="img/Years Active Images/hip hop and rap.png" alt="Hip Hop and Rap Plot" height="550" width="1100" />
				<p>Hip Hop and Rap is the perfect examples of modern Genres. It is evident that until 1990 this genre was almost non-existent. With the coming of the '90s though it grew suddenly and managed to quadriple the number of artists in the last 20 years. Furthermore, More than a 1000 new artists became active in just the last decade.</p>
			</div>

			</div>
			<div class="folk hide">
				<img src="img/Years Active Images/folk.png" alt="Folk Plot" height="550" width="1100" />

			</div>
			<div class="easy hide">
				<img src="img/Years Active Images/easy listening.png" alt="Easy Listening Plot" height="550" width="1100" />
				<p>Easy Listening is a Genre that refers to less than 160 artists. Its pattern is interesting to analyse though. We spot a sharp increase at 1985 peaking at 1990 and then starting to fall downwards up until 2010 where it seems it saw some kind of revival.</p>

		<p></p>
		<p>Looking at how many years each Artists is Active tells us about the growth of the genre in general but does not tell us how the genre actually evolved with every decade change, since the artists that remain active for a lot of years appear and get counted in every following decade, thus increasing the number of artists in every decade. Thus, we will try to see what happens if we plot the number of artists in each decade based only on the artists that got actually created in this decade.</p>
